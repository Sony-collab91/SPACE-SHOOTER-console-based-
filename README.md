# SPACE-SHOOTER-console-based-
Space Shooter is a simple console game in which the player controls a spaceship that can move left or right and shoot bullets to destroy enemy ships. If an enemy reaches or hits the player, one life is lost. After losing all lives, the game restarts from level 1. When the player’s score becomes greater than or equal to (level × 10), the player advances to the next level. With each level, the number of enemies and game speed increase. The game uses colored ASCII graphics to give a retro gaming experience. The highest score is saved in a file and displayed when the game starts.
